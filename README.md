🧠 How It Works

The system starts with a menu where the user can create an account or log in.

When creating an account, a unique account number is generated automatically.

After logging in, the user can:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

View balance

See transaction history

All account and transaction data is stored in bank.json, so it persists between runs.
